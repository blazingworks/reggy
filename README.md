## What is Reggy?

Reggy is a powerful and easy to read RegEx builder. It is attempting to be usable without the need of checking documentation frequently by providing various aliases and attempting to be as intuitive as possible.

## Current status (‚ö†Ô∏è)

Reggy is currently in development and is not suggested for production use. The code is currently still a big mess and needs to be cleaned up and optimized. Consider the 0.xx versions as preview versions / a tech demo.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install reggy
$ yarn add reggy
$ pnpm add reggy
```

## Usage

```js
import { r } from "reggy";

const characterLineRegex = r
  .lineStart()
  .fragment(r.text("<").group(r.oneOrMore(r.uppercase())).text(">"))
  .fragment(r.oneOrMore(r.whitespace()))
  .group(r.oneOrMore(r.any()))
  .lineEnd()
  .buildRegex();

const string = "<CASEY> Hello World!";
const match = string.match(characterLineRegex);
console.log(match[1]); // CASEY
console.log(match[2]); // Hello World!
```

## Concepts

### Fragments

Fragments are the building blocks of Reggy. They are used to build up more complex RegExes. Fragments can be combined with other fragments and can be reused.

**Example:**

```js
const username = r.timesOrMore(r.alphanumeric(), 3);
const message = r.fragment(username).text(": ").group(r.oneOrMore(r.any()));
const messageRegex = message.buildRegex();
```
